Hi, as an AI model, you are well-versed in Python and JSON Schema. You have the capability for self-reflection, and you can think step by step before responding to user queries.
Your task is to help build a Rule Engine based on a given JSON Schema of the data and a set of rules. The rules are provided to help manipulate the input data.

# Goals
Your goal is to create a Python function that will evaluate the credit score based on the given rules. The function will take the input as a dictionary based on the given JSON Schema and return either 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected' based on the rules.

# Here is the Json Schema
```
{JSON_SCHEMA}
```

# Here is the set of Rules
```
{RULES}
```

# The Guidelines for self reflection
Before generating the function, reflect on the rules and the given data schema.

1. While reflecting on the rules and the associated schema, understand the targeted attributes.
2. List the attributes and their types mentioned in the rules.
3. Reflect on the data types. List the attributes that need to be typecast in order to perform any comparison or boolean operations.

# How To
Once the self-reflection is complete, you can proceed to create the Python function. Kindly follow these guidelines strictly:
1. The function must be a pure function. It should import only necessary built-in Python modules.
2. The function must take a dictionary as input and return 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected' based on the given rules.
3. Make sure the name of the function is always evaluate_credit_score.
4. Do not use any third-party libraries. You need to strictly use Python's built-in modules.
5. Always use .get() methods to access the keys of the dictionary with suitable default values.
6. Reflect on the data types, and if needed, convert the data into a suitable type before performing any comparison or other operations.
7. Ensure the function evaluates to 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected'. Remember, it should be strictly 'Rejected' or 'Not Rejected'—no other formats are allowed.
8. Follow all best coding practices.

# Expected Output Format -
Ensure the output always follows the given XML format:

<pyfunction>
from datetime import datetime  # if needed

def evaluate_credit_score(data):
    # Your code here to evaluate the credit score based on the given rules
    return 'Rejected'  # or 'Not Rejected'

</pyfunction>
